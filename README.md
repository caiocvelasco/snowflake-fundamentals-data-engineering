## 1. Snowflake Architecture & Performance Fundamentals

### 1.1 Why Snowflake Exists

Before Snowflake, most companies used **on-premises data warehouses** such as Oracle, Teradata, or SQL Server.  
These systems were powerful, but they suffered from three major limitations:

| Problem | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Rigid scalability** | To handle more data or users, you had to buy and install new hardware. |
| **Compute & storage tightly coupled** | You paid for both, even when idle. A heavy query could block everyone else. |
| **Complex maintenance** | Patching, backups, tuning indexes - all manual. |

Snowflake was born as a **cloud-native data warehouse** designed to solve these issues through:
- **Elastic scalability** → pay only for what you use  
- **Separation of compute and storage** → multiple teams can query the same data independently  
- **Automatic optimization** → no manual partitioning or indexing required  

---

### 1.2 The Three-Layer Architecture

Snowflake is built around a **3-layer architecture**, each layer with its own purpose.

| Layer | Description | Analogy |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Storage Layer** | Stores all data in *micro-partitions* (compressed, columnar chunks of ~16 MB). | The library shelves holding books (data). |
| **Compute Layer** | Executes queries through *virtual warehouses* (clusters of compute nodes). | Librarians reading and summarizing books. |
| **Cloud Services Layer** | Coordinates everything: SQL parsing, optimization, metadata, RBAC, caching. | The library manager who knows where every book is and assigns tasks. |

---

### 1.3 Storage Layer: Data & Micro-Partitions & Pruning

#### Fundamentals
- Data is stored in immutable, compressed **micro-partitions** (~16 MB uncompressed).
- Each partition keeps **metadata**: min/max values, row counts, null counts.
- Snowflake automatically decides how to partition - no manual setup.
- This metadata allows **partition pruning** (skipping irrelevant data).

First, let's make clear the difference between **S3 partitioning** and **Snowflake micro-partitioning**.

#### S3 Partitionning vs. Snowflake Partitioning

| Concept | Where it happens | Who defines it | Example |
|----------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Folder partitioning** | In S3 (external data) | You | `s3://sales/year=2025/month=10/day=01/` |
| **Micro-partitioning** | Inside Snowflake | Automatic | Snowflake splits the table into small internal chunks |

**S3 partitioning** helps *organize* data before loading and optimizes query performance.  
**Micro-partitioning** helps *query* data efficiently after loading, so it's also a layer of query performance.

#### Example

Suppose you have 1 billion orders loaded into Snowflake:

| Partition | Date range | Row count |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| P1 | 2023-01-01 → 2023-03-31 | 250 M |
| P2 | 2023-04-01 → 2023-06-30 | 250 M |
| P3 | 2023-07-01 → 2023-09-30 | 250 M |
| P4 | 2023-10-01 → 2023-12-31 | 250 M |

Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2023-07-01';
```

Snowflake automatically scans only partitions **P3** and **P4**.  
This is **partition pruning**, and it happens inside the **storage layer**.

---

### 1.4 Compute Layer: Virtual Warehouses, Parallelism & Optimizer

#### Fundamentals
- A **virtual warehouse** = compute cluster that runs queries.
- Each warehouse can be sized (`X-SMALL` to `4X-LARGE`) and scaled *up* or *out*.
- Multiple warehouses can access the same data **independently** (no locking).
- Compute cost = active warehouse time × size.

#### Parallel Processing

Snowflake uses **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**:
- Each warehouse has many compute nodes.
- Each node processes a subset of micro-partitions **at the same time**.
- Results are combined and returned.

**Analogy**  
> Instead of one person reading 1000 books sequentially,  
> 100 people each read 10 books and share their summaries.  
> That’s parallelism. This saves a lot of time (100x faster in this case)!

#### Example
```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY region;
```
- The Snowflake **"Optimizer"** divides a table into micro-partitions.
- 8 compute nodes (in a MEDIUM warehouse) each read a portion in **parallel**.
- Nodes send partial results → Snowflake merges them → result returned.

---

### 1.5 Cloud Services Layer: The “Brain”

The **Cloud Services Layer** is Snowflake’s *central nervous system*.  
It coordinates all query operations and ensures that storage, compute, and user permissions work together smoothly.  
No data is stored here — it’s all **metadata, orchestration, and optimization**.

---

#### 🧠 The Optimizer — The Query "Planner"

When you submit a SQL query, the **Optimizer** (inside this layer) becomes the planner and strategist.

**Its goal:**  
👉 Transform your SQL statement into the *most efficient execution plan possible.*

**Key Responsibilities:**
1. **Parse and rewrite SQL** — validate syntax, resolve references, and simplify logic.  
2. **Build an execution plan** — decide how to access tables, join them, and aggregate results.  
3. **Leverage metadata cache** — determine which micro-partitions to read and which to skip (*partition pruning*).  
4. **Select execution strategies** — e.g., hash join vs. broadcast join, aggregation order, etc.  
5. **Distribute work** — assign tasks to compute nodes for parallel execution.  

**Analogy:**  
> Think of the Optimizer as a head chef planning the entire recipe before anyone starts cooking.  
> The compute layer are the sous-chefs who just execute the plan efficiently.

---

#### ⚙️ Example: The Optimizer in Action

```sql
SELECT c.country, SUM(o.amount)
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.country;
```
Here’s what happens before any data is read:

1. **Parsing:** The optimizer validates the SQL syntax.  
2. **Planning:** It inspects metadata - finds that only 20% of micro-partitions have `order_date >= '2024-01-01'`.  
3. **Optimization:** It selects a **hash join** (both tables large) and determines partition pruning rules.  
4. **Distribution:** It assigns subsets of data to each compute node to process in parallel.  
5. **Execution:** The compute layer receives this plan and executes it exactly as instructed.

---

#### Other Components of the Cloud Services Layer

Beyond the optimizer, this layer also manages:

| Function | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Metadata management** | Keeps catalog of all databases, schemas, tables, and micro-partitions. |
| **Security & RBAC** | Verifies that the active role has privileges for each object accessed. |
| **Caching coordination** | Controls result cache and metadata cache usage. |
| **Session management** | Tracks active users, queries, and warehouses. |
| **Query compilation** | Translates SQL plans into execution instructions for compute clusters. |

---

#### Example - Full Cloud Services Flow

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE region = 'Europe';
```

1. **Authentication & RBAC:** Check if the user’s role can read `orders`.  
2. **Optimization:** Read partition metadata → find which contain `'Europe'`.  
3. **Planning:** Build the execution plan and send it to the compute layer.  
4. **Execution:** Compute layer reads only the relevant partitions in parallel.  
5. **Aggregation & Return:** Results are combined and returned to the user.

> The Cloud Services Layer doesn’t store data  it stores *knowledge about data*.  
> It’s what makes Snowflake **smart, elastic, and self-optimizing.**

---

### 1.6 Caching: Remembering Previous Work

Caching = reusing previous data or results to save time and cost.

| Cache Type | Where | Stores | Reused When |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Result cache** | Cloud Services Layer | Final results of identical queries | Same SQL *and* same data snapshot |
| **Metadata cache** | Cloud Services Layer | Micro-partition statistics | Always used for pruning |
| **Local cache** | Compute Layer | Recently read micro-partitions | Same warehouse runs again before suspension |

---

#### Deep Dive - “Same SQL” and “Same Data”

Snowflake has multiple caches that operate at different levels. As seen above, they are the _Result Cache_, _Local Cache_, and _Metadata Cache_.

Each one “remembers” something different. Let’s break them down:

#### Result Cache (Same SQL, Same Data)

**What it stores**
- The final output (rows/aggregates) of a query.  
- Stored for 24 hours in the *Cloud Services layer*.

**“Same SQL”** means the text of the query is identical - even a space or comment breaks the match.  
**“Same data”** means the underlying tables haven’t changed since the cache was created.

```sql
-- First run
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
-- Second run
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
```
The second query returns instantly from **result cache** because:
- Query text is identical.
- The `orders` table has not changed.

If new rows are inserted, the cache is invalidated because the data snapshot changed.

---

#### Local Cache (Same Data Accessed Again by the Same Warehouse)

**What it stores**
- The *raw micro-partitions* (data chunks) recently read from the storage layer.  
- Stored in the *Compute layer (warehouse memory)*.

**“Same data”** means the *same micro-partitions are being requested again*, and the warehouse hasn’t suspended.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
```
These two queries are *not identical* SQL, so result cache can’t be used.  
But the same data (`Europe` partitions) is already in memory → reused from **local cache**.

> Think of it like fetching pages of a book to your desk: 
> -> you can re-read or analyze them differently without going back to the library.

---

#### Metadata Cache (Used by the Optimizer)

The **Metadata Cache** is always active and operates behind the scenes in the **Cloud Services Layer**.

**What It Stores**
- Summary information (metadata) about each **micro-partition**:
  - Minimum and maximum values per column, Row counts and null counts, File and partition locations, Data versioning information.

This metadata is lightweight but extremely valuable. 

-> It allows the **optimizer** to know where data is located **without reading it first**.

**Why It Matters**
Before any query runs, the optimizer:
1. Reads the metadata cache.  
2. Determines which micro-partitions are **relevant** for your filters.  
3. Skips the rest entirely - a process called **partition pruning**.

This saves both time and compute cost because irrelevant data is never scanned.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

Snowflake checks metadata:  
- Partition 1 → max(order_date) = 2023-12-31 → ❌ skipped
- Partition 2 → min(order_date) = 2024-01-01 → ✅ scanned

No actual data is read until the optimizer knows exactly which partitions matter!

---

### 1.7 Security Overview - Understanding RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Snowflake’s security model is built on **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** —  
every user acts *through a role*, and that role defines *what they can see or do*.

#### Core Principles

| Concept | Description | Analogy |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Users** | Represent individual people or service accounts. | People entering a building. |
| **Roles** | Define *sets of privileges* (what actions are allowed). | ID badges giving access to rooms. |
| **Privileges** | Specific permissions (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, USAGE). | Keys that open certain doors. |
| **Objects** | The things being protected (databases, schemas, tables, etc.). | The rooms themselves. |
| **Grants** | Connect roles ↔ privileges ↔ objects ↔ users. | Giving a badge access to a door. |

**Users never get direct privileges** - only roles do. This makes permission management cleaner and auditable.

---

#### Basic Hierarchy

```text
Role → Privilege → Object
User → Role
```

Or in English:
> A user has a role.
> A role has privileges.
> Privileges apply to objects (databases, schemas, tables...).

#### Example - Creating and Assigning Roles

```sql
-- 1. Create a role for analysts
CREATE ROLE analyst;

-- 2. Grant privileges to that role
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales TO ROLE analyst;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA sales.public TO ROLE analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales.public.orders TO ROLE analyst;

-- 3. Assign role to user
GRANT ROLE analyst TO USER caio;
```

Now user **Caio** can query the `orders` table via their `analyst` role. This avoids potential problems such as deleting data, accessing other databases or seeing sensitive information.

---

#### Role Hierarchies (Parent/Child Roles)

Roles can inherit from other roles.  
For example:

```sql
GRANT ROLE analyst TO ROLE senior_analyst;
GRANT ROLE senior_analyst TO ROLE analytics_admin;
```

This creates a **role tree**:

```
analytics_admin
   └── senior_analyst
         └── analyst
```

The higher roles automatically inherit privileges from the lower ones.

---

#### System Roles

Snowflake includes built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **ACCOUNTADMIN** | Full control over the account (everything). |
| **SECURITYADMIN** | Manages roles, users, and grants. |
| **SYSADMIN** | Manages databases, schemas, and objects. |
| **PUBLIC** | Default role with minimal privileges. |

**Best practice:** Use _least privilege_ - give users the minimum necessary role to do their job.

---

#### Best Practices

| Practice | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Use role hierarchies | Simplifies permission management. |
| Never assign privileges directly to users | Keeps audits and role rotations clean. |
| Create separate roles for read, write, admin | Clear separation of duties. |
| Regularly review grants | Prevent privilege creep. |

---

#### Summary

| Level | Example | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Database** | `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales TO ROLE analyst;` | Grants visibility to a database. |
| **Schema** | `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA sales.public TO ROLE analyst;` | Allows seeing objects in a schema. |
| **Table** | `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales.public.orders TO ROLE analyst;` | Allows querying a table. |
| **Role assignment** | `GRANT ROLE analyst TO USER caio;` | Gives user access through a role. |

**Roles → Privileges → Objects → Users**: This chain defines *everything* about access in Snowflake.

---

### 1.8 Performance Optimization Techniques

Performance tuning in Snowflake means helping the **Optimizer** and the **Compute Layer** do *less work*.  
That means:  
- Reading less data  
- Caching more effectively  
- Using compute power efficiently  

---

#### Clustering (Organizing Data for Pruning)

**Definition:**  
Clustering organizes rows inside micro-partitions so that values of one or more columns are physically close together.  

**Why it matters:**  
It improves **partition pruning** - Snowflake can skip entire chunks of data because related values are stored together.

**Example:**  
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders CLUSTER BY (country, order_date);
```

Now all rows with the same `country` and `order_date` ranges are near each other — pruning becomes sharper.

You can inspect clustering quality with:  
```sql
SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('orders');
```

**Analogy:**  
> Imagine sorting a library so that all “Europe” books are on one shelf - the librarian finds them faster!

---

#### Views vs. Materialized Views

| Type | Stores Data? | Updated Automatically? | When to Use |
|------|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **View** | ❌ No | N/A | For lightweight, dynamic queries. |
| **Materialized View** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | For heavy or repeated aggregations. |

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW v_orders_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_orders_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;
```

The second one **runs instantly** since results are precomputed.

---

#### Profiling (Measuring Query Performance)

**Definition:**  
Profiling means examining how a query actually ran - which steps were slow, how many partitions were read, and how compute was distributed.

**How to Access:**  
- Snowflake UI → **Query History → Profile**  
- SQL via `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`

| Component | Description | Example insight |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Query Plan Graph** | Visual DAG showing each step (scan, join, aggregate). | Detect unbalanced joins or bottlenecks. |
| **Bytes scanned** | Total data read. | Too high = poor pruning or missing clustering. |
| **Partitions scanned** | How many micro-partitions were accessed. | Should be much smaller than total. |
| **Elapsed time per step** | Execution time per operation. | Helps find slow joins or aggregations. |

**Example Insight:**  
If profiling shows most time spent on “join,” try clustering or filtering earlier.

---

#### Core Optimization Areas

| Area | Technique | Why it helps | Example or Tip |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **1. Query pruning** | Use filters on columns Snowflake can prune. | Reduces number of micro-partitions scanned. | Filter on `order_date` instead of `DATE(order_date)`. |
| **2. Clustering keys** | Group large tables by frequently filtered columns. | Keeps data ordered for faster pruning. | `ALTER TABLE orders CLUSTER BY (country, order_date);` |
| **3. Warehouse sizing** | Choose the right size and enable auto-suspend. | Balances cost and speed. | Short bursts → medium; long queries → large. |
| **4. Materialized views** | Store pre-aggregated results. | Avoids recomputation for dashboards. | `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales AS SELECT region, SUM(amount)...` |
| **5. Caching** | Reuse result/local/metadata caches. | Saves compute and I/O. | Run related queries in the same warehouse. |
| **6. Query profiling** | Inspect execution plans. | Identify bottlenecks. | Use the Web UI or `QUERY_HISTORY()`. |

---

#### Example - Optimizing a Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE country = 'DE'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Possible improvements:**

1. **Clustering**  
   - Cluster by `(country)` or `(country, order_date)` for better pruning.  

2. **Avoid Functions on Filter Columns**  
   - Don’t wrap filters in functions like `LOWER(country) = 'de'`; this prevents pruning.  

3. **Scale Appropriately**  
   - Scale **up** for faster single queries or **out** for concurrency.  

4. **Materialized View**  
   - Precompute if it’s a common aggregation:  
     ```sql
     CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_orders_de AS
     SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
     FROM orders
     WHERE country = 'DE'
     GROUP BY customer_id;
     ```

5. **Inspect the Query Profile**  
   - Check *Query History → Profile* for large scans or skewed joins.

---

#### Visualization - How Query Pruning Works

```
orders table
├── Partition 1 → country=US  (skipped)
├── Partition 2 → country=ES  (skipped)
├── Partition 3 → country=DE  ✅ scanned
├── Partition 4 → country=DE  ✅ scanned
└── Partition 5 → country=FR  (skipped)
```

Out of 5 partitions, only 2 are read — 60% of the work is saved.

---

#### Fundamental Rule of Thumb

> **Snowflake doesn’t get slow - it just scans more data than necessary.**  
> Optimization means guiding the optimizer to touch as few micro-partitions as possible.

---

#### Bonus: Useful Views & Functions

| View / Function | Description | Example |
|------------------|--------------|----------|
| `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` | Query metadata for performance review. | Find queries with long execution time. |
| `TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS` | See table size and micro-partition stats. | Identify bloated tables for reclustering. |
| `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('table_name')` | Shows clustering depth and effectiveness. | Monitor large tables for re-clustering needs. |

---

#### Optimization Checklist

- [ ] My filters enable **partition pruning** (no unnecessary functions).  
- [ ] I use **clustering keys** for very large, frequently filtered tables.  
- [ ] My **warehouses auto-suspend** when idle to save cost.  
- [ ] I **reuse warehouses** to take advantage of caching.  
- [ ] I **profile queries** regularly to identify slow joins or large scans.  
- [ ] I use **materialized views** for repeated aggregations.  

---

#### Summary - What Optimization Really Means

> Snowflake optimization isn’t about “tuning knobs.”  
> It’s about *helping the optimizer do less work*.  
>  
> - Store data intelligently (partitioning, clustering).  
> - Write filter-friendly SQL.  
> - Use warehouses efficiently.  
> - Let caching and materialization handle repetition.  
>  
> In short: **read less, compute smarter, and pay only for what you need.**

## 2. Procedural SQL, Streams & Tasks

### 2.1 Stored Procedures & Snowflake Scripting

#### Why Procedural SQL Exists

Standard SQL is **declarative** - you describe *what* you want (e.g., “select all orders from Germany”), and the engine decides *how* to get it.  

However, in real-world pipelines, you often need **multi-step logic**:
- Conditional flows (`IF / ELSE`)
- Loops
- Variables and intermediate results
- Error handling
- Controlled transactions (BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK)

That’s where **Procedural SQL** and **Stored Procedures** come in - they let you write **scripts** that orchestrate complex transformations *inside Snowflake itself*.

---

#### Two Ways to Write Logic in Snowflake

| Language | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Snowflake Scripting (SQL dialect)** | Native procedural SQL syntax (similar to PL/SQL or T-SQL). | When you want to stay entirely in SQL. |
| **JavaScript Stored Procedures** | Use JavaScript with SQL commands embedded (`snowflake.execute()`). | When logic or branching is complex (loops, string ops, API calls). |

Both are **executed in Snowflake’s compute layer**, close to the data — no need to move data to Python or an external system.

---

#### Example 1 - Simple Snowflake Scripting Block

```sql
BEGIN
    LET country := 'DE';
    LET total := (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE country = :country);
    RETURN 'Total orders for ' || :country || ' = ' || :total;
END;
```

**Explanation:**
1. `BEGIN ... END` defines a scripting block.  
2. `LET` declares variables.  
3. `:` is used to reference variables.  
4. The script executes SQL and returns a string.

Output example: _Total orders for DE = 13412_


---

**How it works — step by step**

1. **Definition & Creation**  
   - `CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE` defines a *named routine* stored inside your database schema.  
   - Once created, anyone with the right privileges can call it like a built-in function.

2. **Return Type**  
   - `RETURNS STRING` specifies the data type of what the procedure will return -  
     in this case, just a simple message confirming the load.

3. **Language Declaration**  
   - `LANGUAGE SQL` tells Snowflake to interpret the body using **Snowflake Scripting syntax**,  
     not JavaScript.  
   - The body of the procedure is enclosed between the double dollar signs `$$ ... $$`.

4. **Variable Declaration**  
   - Inside the `DECLARE` block, `v_today` is defined as a variable and initialized to the current date.  
   - You can later reference this variable using `:v_today`.

5. **Business Logic**  
   - The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...` statement loads only rows from `staging_sales`  
     where `sales_date` equals the current date.  
   - This keeps the daily load idempotent - it only touches the relevant partition.

6. **Return Statement**  
   - `RETURN 'Data loaded for ' || v_today;` concatenates a success message and returns it to the user.

7. **Execution Context**  
   - The whole block runs atomically: if any part fails, the entire transaction rolls back automatically.

---

**To run it:**

```sql
CALL load_daily_sales();
```

**Expected Output Example:**
```
+------------------------------------+
| CALL_RESULT |
+------------------------------------+
| Data loaded for 2025-10-20 |
+------------------------------------+
```

**In short:**  
This procedure represents a *basic daily ETL load pattern* in Snowflake - self-contained, reusable, and executed directly where the data lives.

---

#### Example 3 - Stored Procedure Using JavaScript

Sometimes, more control or looping is needed. Snowflake also supports **JavaScript procedures** with embedded SQL.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE merge_incremental()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    var cmd = `
        MERGE INTO fact_orders t
        USING staging_orders s
        ON t.order_id = s.order_id
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET amount = s.amount
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (order_id, amount) VALUES (s.order_id, s.amount);
    `;
    snowflake.execute({sqlText: cmd});
    return "Incremental merge completed.";
$$;
```

**Key idea:**  
- You can dynamically build SQL text and execute it.  
- Perfect for looping over tables, handling errors, or running conditionally.

---

#### Control Flow Syntax (Quick Reference)

| Structure | Example | Purpose |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **IF / ELSE** | `IF v_total > 0 THEN RETURN 'ok'; ELSE RETURN 'empty'; END IF;` | Conditional logic. |
| **FOR loop** | `FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM table) DO ... END FOR;` | Iterate over query results. |
| **WHILE loop** | `WHILE v_count < 10 DO ... END WHILE;` | Repeat until condition met. |
| **TRY / CATCH** | `EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN RETURN 'error';` | Error handling. |
| **Transactions** | `BEGIN; ... COMMIT;` | Atomic group of statements. |

#### Analogy

> Think of a stored procedure as a **recipe card** you keep in the kitchen (the database).  
> Each time you “CALL” it, Snowflake follows the exact steps, using the freshest ingredients (current data).

#### Best Practices

| Tip | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Keep procedures small and modular. | Easier debugging and reuse. |
| Use variables for parameters (dates, regions, etc.). | Avoid hardcoding. |
| Include exception handling. | Prevent partial data loads. |
| Log operations into an audit table. | Improves observability. |
| Combine with **Streams + Tasks** (next sections). | Enables automated incremental pipelines. |

#### Quick Recap

- [ ] I understand the difference between **declarative SQL** and **procedural SQL**.  
- [ ] I know the two types of stored procedures: **SQL scripting** and **JavaScript**.  
- [ ] I can create and call a basic stored procedure.  
- [ ] I know how to use **variables, loops, and conditionals**.  
- [ ] I understand why stored procedures are used in ETL/ELT workflows.

#### Example 3 - Stored Procedure Using JavaScript

Sometimes, more control or looping is needed. Snowflake also supports **JavaScript procedures** with embedded SQL.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE merge_incremental()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    var cmd = `
        MERGE INTO fact_orders t
        USING staging_orders s
        ON t.order_id = s.order_id
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET amount = s.amount
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (order_id, amount) VALUES (s.order_id, s.amount);
    `;
    snowflake.execute({sqlText: cmd});
    return "Incremental merge completed.";
$$;
```

**Key idea:**  
- You can dynamically build SQL text and execute it.  
- Perfect for looping over tables, handling errors, or running conditionally.
