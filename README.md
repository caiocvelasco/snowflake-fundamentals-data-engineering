## 1. Snowflake Architecture & Performance Fundamentals

### 1.1 Why Snowflake Exists

Before Snowflake, most companies used **on-premises data warehouses** such as Oracle, Teradata, or SQL Server.  
These systems were powerful, but they suffered from three major limitations:

| Problem | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Rigid scalability** | To handle more data or users, you had to buy and install new hardware. |
| **Compute & storage tightly coupled** | You paid for both, even when idle. A heavy query could block everyone else. |
| **Complex maintenance** | Patching, backups, tuning indexes - all manual. |

Snowflake was born as a **cloud-native data warehouse** designed to solve these issues through:
- **Elastic scalability** → pay only for what you use  
- **Separation of compute and storage** → multiple teams can query the same data independently  
- **Automatic optimization** → no manual partitioning or indexing required

### 1.2 The Three-Layer Architecture

Snowflake is built around a **3-layer architecture**, each layer with its own purpose.

| Layer | Description | Analogy |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Storage Layer** | Stores all data in *micro-partitions* (compressed, columnar chunks of ~16 MB). | The library shelves holding books (data). |
| **Compute Layer** | Executes queries through *virtual warehouses* (clusters of compute nodes). | Librarians reading and summarizing books. |
| **Cloud Services Layer** | Coordinates everything: SQL parsing, optimization, metadata, RBAC, caching. | The library manager who knows where every book is and assigns tasks. |

---

### 1.3 Storage Layer: Data & Micro-Partitions & Pruning

#### Fundamentals
- Data is stored in immutable, compressed **micro-partitions** (~16 MB uncompressed).
- Each partition keeps **metadata**: min/max values, row counts, null counts.
- Snowflake automatically decides how to partition - no manual setup.
- This metadata allows **partition pruning** (skipping irrelevant data).

First, let's make clear the difference between **S3 partitioning** and **Snowflake micro-partitioning**.

#### S3 Partitionning vs. Snowflake Partitioning

| Concept | Where it happens | Who defines it | Example |
|----------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Folder partitioning** | In S3 (external data) | You | `s3://sales/year=2025/month=10/day=01/` |
| **Micro-partitioning** | Inside Snowflake | Automatic | Snowflake splits the table into small internal chunks |

**S3 partitioning** helps *organize* data before loading and optimizes query performance.  
**Micro-partitioning** helps *query* data efficiently after loading, so it's also a layer of query performance.

#### Example

Suppose you have 1 billion orders loaded into Snowflake:

| Partition | Date range | Row count |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| P1 | 2023-01-01 → 2023-03-31 | 250 M |
| P2 | 2023-04-01 → 2023-06-30 | 250 M |
| P3 | 2023-07-01 → 2023-09-30 | 250 M |
| P4 | 2023-10-01 → 2023-12-31 | 250 M |

Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2023-07-01';
```

Snowflake automatically scans only partitions **P3** and **P4**.  
This is **partition pruning**, and it happens inside the **storage layer**.

---

### 1.4 Compute Layer: Virtual Warehouses & Parallelism

#### Fundamentals
- A **virtual warehouse** = compute cluster that runs queries.
- Each warehouse can be sized (`X-SMALL` to `4X-LARGE`) and scaled *up* or *out*.
- Multiple warehouses can access the same data **independently** (no locking).
- Compute cost = active warehouse time × size.

#### Parallel Processing

Snowflake uses **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)**:
- Each warehouse has many compute nodes.
- Each node processes a subset of micro-partitions **at the same time**.
- Results are combined and returned.

**Analogy**  
> Instead of one person reading 1000 books sequentially,  
> 100 people each read 10 books and share their summaries.  
> That’s parallelism. This saves a lot of time (100x faster in this case)!

#### Example
```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
GROUP BY region;
```
- The Snowflake **"Optimizer"** divides a table into micro-partitions.
- 8 compute nodes (in a MEDIUM warehouse) each read a portion in **parallel**.
- Nodes send partial results → Snowflake merges them → result returned.

---

### 1.5 Cloud Services Layer: The “Brain”

#### Responsibilities
- **Parse & optimize** SQL queries.  
- **Decide** which micro-partitions to read (_pruning_).  
- **Assign** work to compute nodes.  
- **Check** permissions via RBAC.  
- **Manage** caches and query metadata.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE region = 'Europe';
```
1. Cloud Services parses query & checks role privileges.  
2. Reads metadata → only partitions containing `'Europe'`.  
3. Tells compute layer which partitions to read.  
4. Combines results and sends them back.

---

### 1.6 Caching: Remembering Previous Work

Caching = reusing previous data or results to save time and cost.

| Cache Type | Where | Stores | Reused When |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Result cache** | Cloud Services Layer | Final results of identical queries | Same SQL *and* same data snapshot |
| **Metadata cache** | Cloud Services Layer | Micro-partition statistics | Always used for pruning |
| **Local cache** | Compute Layer | Recently read micro-partitions | Same warehouse runs again before suspension |

---

## Deep Dive - “Same SQL” and “Same Data”

Snowflake has multiple caches that operate at different levels. As seen above, they are the _Result Cache_, _Local Cache_, and _Metadata Cache_.

Each one “remembers” something different. Let’s break them down:

### Result Cache (Same SQL, Same Data)

**What it stores**
- The final output (rows/aggregates) of a query.  
- Stored for 24 hours in the *Cloud Services layer*.

**“Same SQL”** means the text of the query is identical - even a space or comment breaks the match.  
**“Same data”** means the underlying tables haven’t changed since the cache was created.

```sql
-- First run
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
-- Second run
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
```
The second query returns instantly from **result cache** because:
- Query text is identical.
- The `orders` table has not changed.

If new rows are inserted, the cache is invalidated because the data snapshot changed.

---

### Local Cache (Same Data Accessed Again by the Same Warehouse)

**What it stores**
- The *raw micro-partitions* (data chunks) recently read from the storage layer.  
- Stored in the *Compute layer (warehouse memory)*.

**“Same data”** means the *same micro-partitions are being requested again*, and the warehouse hasn’t suspended.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders WHERE region='Europe';
```
These two queries are *not identical* SQL, so result cache can’t be used.  
But the same data (`Europe` partitions) is already in memory → reused from **local cache**.

> Think of it like fetching pages of a book to your desk: 
> -> you can re-read or analyze them differently without going back to the library.

---

### Metadata Cache (Used by the Optimizer)

The **Metadata Cache** is always active and operates behind the scenes in the **Cloud Services Layer**.

#### What It Stores
- Summary information (metadata) about each **micro-partition**:
  - Minimum and maximum values per column, Row counts and null counts, File and partition locations, Data versioning information.

This metadata is lightweight but extremely valuable. 

-> It allows the **optimizer** to know where data is located **without reading it first**.

#### ⚙️ Why It Matters
Before any query runs, the optimizer:
1. Reads the metadata cache.  
2. Determines which micro-partitions are **relevant** for your filters.  
3. Skips the rest entirely — a process called **partition pruning**.

This saves both time and compute cost because irrelevant data is never scanned.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

Snowflake checks metadata:  
- Partition 1 → max(order_date) = 2023-12-31 → ❌ skipped
- Partition 2 → min(order_date) = 2024-01-01 → ✅ scanned

No actual data is read until the optimizer knows exactly which partitions matter!

### 🔐 1.7 Security Overview (RBAC Basics)

Snowflake uses **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC):

| Object | Grant example |
|---------|----------------|
| Database | `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales TO ROLE analyst;` |
| Schema | `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA sales.public TO ROLE analyst;` |
| Table | `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales.public.orders TO ROLE analyst;` |
| Role assignment | `GRANT ROLE analyst TO USER caio;` |

Roles → Privileges → Objects → Users.

### 🚀 1.8 Performance Optimization Techniques

| Area | Technique | Why it helps |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Query pruning** | Use filters on columns Snowflake can prune. | Reads fewer partitions. |
| **Clustering keys** | Group data manually by frequent filters. | Improves pruning for large tables. |
| **Warehouse sizing** | Scale wisely, use auto-suspend. | Reduces cost. |
| **Materialized views** | Pre-compute common aggregations. | Faster dashboards. |
| **Query profiling** | Use `QUERY_HISTORY()` or UI profiler. | Identify slow steps. |

#### Example
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM orders
WHERE country = 'DE'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
Possible optimizations:
- Cluster by `(country)` for better pruning.  
- Materialize frequent aggregates.  
- Scale out if concurrency is high.
